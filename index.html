      The Marine Commandos, abbreviated to MARCOS and officially called the Marine Commando Force (MCF), are the special
      forces unit of the Indian Navy and is responsible for conducting special operations.[Note 1]

      The MARCOS were founded in February 1987. MARCOS are capable of operating in all types of environments; at sea, in
      air and on land.[1][7] The force has gradually acquired more experience and an international reputation for
      professionalism.[1][8] The MARCOS regularly undertake specialised maritime operations in Jammu and Kashmir through
      the Jhelum River and Wular Lake, a 65 square kilometres (16,000 acres) freshwater lake, and conduct
      counter-insurgency operations in the region.[9][7]

      Some MARCOS units are a part of the tri-services Armed Forces Special Operations Division.[10]In 1955, the Indian
      military established a diving school at Cochin with the assistance of the British Special Boat Service and began
      teaching combat divers skills such as explosive disposal, clearance, and salvage diving. The combat divers failed
      to achieve their desired outcomes during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 as they were not adequately trained for
      sabotage missions.[11][12] The combat divers had also taught basic underwater demolition training to insurgents
      from Bangladesh, who were then sent on missions during the war but did not cause any substantial damage to
      Pakistani military installations. Subsequently, during the war, the Indian Navy assisted the Indian Army in
      landing operations against the Pakistani military base in Cox's Bazar. After the war ended, army units were often
      drafted into amphibious exercises. In 1983, the Indian Army formation called 340th Army Independent Brigade was
      converted into an amphibious assault unit and a series of joint airborne-amphibious exercises were conducted in
      later years.[12]

      In April 1986, the Indian Navy started planning for the creation of a special forces unit that would be capable of
      undertaking missions in a maritime environment, conducting raids and reconnaissance, and counter-terrorism
      operations. Three volunteer officers from the diving unit, which was created in 1955, were selected and underwent
      training courses with the United States Navy SEALs at Coronado. They later went on training exchanges with the
      Special Boat Service. In February 1987, the Indian Marine Special Force (IMSF) officially came into existence and
      the three officers were its first members.[12][11] The IMSF was renamed as 'Marine Commando Force' in 1991.All
      MARCOS personnel are males selected from the Indian Navy when they are in their early 20s and have to go through a
      stringent selection process and training. The selection standards are extremely high. Training is a continuous
      process. American and British special forces assisted in setting up the initial training program, which now
      consists of a two-year course for new recruits. The training regimen includes airborne operations, combat diving
      courses, counter-terrorism, anti-hijacking, anti-piracy operations, direct action, infiltration and exfiltration
      tactics, special reconnaissance and unconventional warfare. Most of the training is conducted at INS Abhimanyu,
      which is also the home base of MARCOS.

      Navy SEALs at Coronado. They later went on training exchanges with the Special Boat Service. In February 1987, the
      Indian Marine Special Force (IMSF) officially came into existence and the three officers were its first
      members.[12][11] The IMSF was renamed as 'Marine Commando Force' in 1991.All MARCOS personnel are males selected
      from the Indian Navy when they are in their early 20s and have to go through a stringent selection process and
      training. The selection standards are extremely high. Training is a continuous process. American and British
      special forces assisted in setting up the initial training program, which now consists of a two-year course for
      new recruits. The training regimen includes airborne operations, combat diving courses, counter-terrorism,
      anti-hijacking, anti-piracy operations, direct action, infiltration and exfiltration tactics, special
      reconnaissance and unconventional warfare. Most of the training is conducted at INS Abhimanyu, which is also the
      home base of MARCOS.
